## Introduction

`![Buddha](buddha.jpg)`

The purpose of this paper is to conduct a meta analysis and an evidence synthesis of the effectiveness of different forms of contemplation for the control of anxiety disorders. It is known that mindfulness meditation that focus on breath and states of mind are useful for the control of anxiety disorders. However, there are other adverse effects and it is not clear as to the summary effect of mindfulness based approaches for the control of anxiety disorders, or which outcome are affected best. In order to summarise the effects of mindfulness based approaches, we would like to conduct a meta analysis of the existing randomised controlled trials, or where randomised trials are not available, other forms ofobservational studies. We will use Gradepro and R for meta analysis for this paper.
